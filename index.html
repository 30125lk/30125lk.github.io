            <h1>An icon of Italian mobility</h1>
            <p>The acronym F.I.A.T. means Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino, but the name FIAT means infinitely more. Founded in 1899, over the years the Turin-based company has become a symbol of Italy’s technological and creative enterprise, which have changed the country and the history of global mobility forever.</p>
            <p>The personality of the Agnelli family, the genius and design vision of Dante Giacosa and the administrative foresight of Vittorio Valletta. The expansion towards the United States and Russia, but also the key base in Turin, in the Lingotto and Mirafiori industrial complexes. The very first Fiat 3 1/2 HP, the unforgettable "Topolino", the iconic 500, and epochal milestones of mobility such as the 600, 124 and Panda. Company growth, mergers and acquisitions. Over 120 years of extraordinary events, charismatic characters, evolutions of the company logo and of course its cars: a long story told on the FCA Heritage website.</p>
